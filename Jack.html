		<p>On this page I am going to tell you all about myself. It should be very interesting to read, if you ask me.</p>
		<p>It all started on the planet Krypton, where I was born. I wasn't what you would call a "normal kid". I was stronger and faster than every other kid. I had a 3.2 second 100 meter dash and could bench 550. I was a machine. Then it all changed when<i> he <i> came to town.
		<p>This kid was the most decietful, hateful, angry person I knew, but he was the only person who I could call a friend. He was the only person who accepted me, until he turned.</p>
		<p>One day (Brady was his hame) he came and I accidentally ate all of his Halloween candy. he hated me for it, even though it was an honest mistake. From that day on, he swore revenge.</p>
		<p>One day I saw Brady walking down the street while I was eating lunch. He saw me. He ran towards me and grabbed my sandwhich right in front of me. He started eating and said "Karma's a jerk." That is my story. I still suffer from PTSD. Please donate and help the cause.</p>

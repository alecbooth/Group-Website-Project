		<h1>Alec's Biography</h1>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Childhood</h3>
		    <p>This is kind of funny because I never really had a childhood. I came out of the hospital with a full experience of what happened; it was terrible. I finished college when I was "3", but society said my age was 23. It was a little awakward when I met humans because I didn't know any social requirements like shaking hands and not using the restroom in the middle of the sidewalk.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Jobs</h3>
		    <p>I started my career as a luxirious McDonald's cashier. Then one day a beautiful woman walked in and ... stole the ketchup. I FREAKED. I tackled the woman and stole it back. When I walked back in to the McDonalds, I expected applause or a celebration. All I got was stares. Then the manager walked in and started yelling at me. I was flabbergasted. Let me repeat I WAS FLABBERGASTED! I ended up being fired. Then a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Jack.</p>
		<br>
		    <p>"I see what ya did there. Good job. I am very proud of you, here take this."</p>
		<br>
		    <p>Jack pointed to 1 million dollars! I asked how he got that and he said he stole it off of Peyton Manning. Right as he said that he was shot in the head and fell to the ground, warm blood spilling on the parking lot.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Retirement</h3>
		    <p>That event kicked off my retirement. I lived humbly and used my money responsibly. I lived on the streets of Denver ocassionaly running into the good samaritan (all of who were named Noah for some reason) who would give me a few dollars. I also met a fellow hobo named Pranav. Pranav told me that he had a wonderful childhood living in Carmel with a wonderful education. Then he told me that in college he lost all of his money to a guy named Pratim. Pranav challenged Pratim to a math debate. Pranav lost.</p>

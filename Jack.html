	  <h1>My Best Friend</h1>
		<p>On this page I am going to tell you all about myself. It should be very interesting to read, if you ask me. It all started on the planet Krypton, where I was born. I wasn't what you would call a "normal kid". I was faster and stronger than every other kid. I had a 33.2 second mile and could bench 650 when I was 15. I was a machine. Then it all changed when<i> he </i> came to town.This kid was the smartest, frendliest person I knew, and he was the only person who I could call a friend. He was the only person who accepted me, until he turned. One day (Brady was his name) he came and I accidentally ate all of his halloween candy. He hated me for it, even though it was an honest mistake. From that day on, he swore revenge.One day I saw Brady walking down the street while I was eating lunch. He saw me. He ran towards me and grabbed my sandwhich right in front of me. He started eating and said "Karma's a jerk." That is my story. I still suffer from PTSD. Please donate and help the cause.</p>

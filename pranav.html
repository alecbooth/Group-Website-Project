	<h2>The Most Interesting Man I Ever Met<h2>
	<p>When I was 12 I met a man named Alev. Alev was super muscular and intelligent. He had many problems though. There was another man named Joc. Joc was always jealous of Alev's super skills. Alev would always greet Joc by saying, "Waz up!!!" but Joc would reply with, "eneh".<p>

	  <u><h2>The Most Interesting Man In The World</h2></u>
	  <p class="noborders">When I was 12 I met a man named Alev. Alev was super muscular and intelligent. He had many problems though. There was another man named Joc. Joc was always jealous of Alev's super skills. Alev would always greet Joc by saying, "Waz up!!!" but Joc would reply with, "eneh".</p>
	  <u><h2> The Story of Alev </h2></u>
	  <p class="noborders"> Alev ended up being nominated for the Least Interesting Man in the World award while Joc got the Most Interesting Man In The World Award, and so our story is over</p>
